Learn how to map Java Objects to database tables and perform CRUD operations using JPA

:eventapp-url: http://localhost:9080/eventmanager.jsf
:get-events-url: http://localhost:9080/events

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use the Java Persistence API (JPA) to map Java objects to database tables.
JPA is a standard for Object Relational Mapping and eliminates the burden of having to write
SQL code when performing database operations.

The application that you will be working with is the `Event Manager`, which provides services for 
creating, retrieving, updating and deleting `Event` objects. The application uses an Embedded Derby 
database as a datastore for all the Event objects. If you want to learn more about Embedded Derby, 
you can do so from the https://db.apache.org/derby/papers/DerbyTut/embedded_intro.html[official website.]

You will use JPA annotations to define an entity class whose persistent fields are persisted to the 
datastore. Every entity object has a lifecycle that consists of different states that are managed by 
an `EntityManager`. In this application, the `EntityManager` is container-managed so the EJB container 
is responsible for transaction boundaries as well as opening and closing the `EntityManager`.

Point your browser to the {eventapp-url} URL. The event application
currently has no events stored in the database. Go ahead and click on the `Create Event` button 
located in the left navigation bar. After entering an event name, location and time, click on `Submit` 
to persist your event entity to the database. The event is now stored in the database and is visible 
in the list of current events.

Notice that if you stop the Open Liberty server:
```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

and then restart it:
```
mvn liberty:start-server
```

The events created are still displayed in the list of current events. The `Update` button located 
beside each event allows you to make modifications to the persisted entity and the `Delete` button 
allows you to remove entities from the database.

// Defining a JPA entity class

== Defining a JPA entity class

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

An entity class must be defined before you are able to use JPA to store Java objects in a database. 
A JPA entity is a Java object whose non-transient fields will be persisted to the database. Any 
Plain Old Java Object (POJO) class can be designated as a JPA entity. However, the class must be 
annotated with the `@Entity` annotation, must not be declared final and must have a public or 
protected non-argument constructor. JPA uses a database table for every entity and persisted 
instances will be represented as one row in the table.

Add the following JPA annotations to the `Event` class in the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/models/Event.java`
file:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/models/Event.java[tags=**;]
----

Let's break down the new annotations:

[cols="35, 200", options="header"]
|===
| *Annotation*    | *Description*
| `@Entity` | Declares the class as an entity
| `@Table`  | Specifies details of the table such as name and schema
| `@NamedQuery` | Specfies a query using a static name
| `@Id`       |   Primary key of the entity
| `@GeneratedValue`    | Specifies the generation strategy for the value of the primary key, 
                        `strategy = GenerationType.AUTO` indicates that the persistence provider 
                        will pick a strategy depending on the database used
| `@Column`    | Specifies that the attribute is mapped to a column in the table, `name` is optional 
                 and indicates the name of the column in the table
|===

// =================================================================================================
// Accessing data using JPA
// =================================================================================================

== Accessing data using JPA

Before being able to access data using JPA, a connection to the database must be established.
An `EntityManager` provides the functionality for performing operations on the database such as
persisting, loading, updating and deleting entities. The `EntityManager`’s configuration is defined
by a persistence unit specified in the `persistence.xml` file.

Create the `src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml` file:

[source, Xml]
----
include::finish/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml[tags=**;]
----

The persistence unit is defined by the
`<persistence-unit name="jpa-unit" transaction-type="JTA"></persistence-unit>` XML element.
You can define multiple persistence units in the same `persistence.xml` file.
The `name` attribute is required and is used to identify the persistent unit. The `transaction-type=”JTA”`
element specifies to use managed (Java Transaction API) transaction management. In a Java EE 
environment, the default is JTA if this element is not specified.

A transaction type of JTA requires for a JTA data source to be provided.
This is done via the `<jta-data-source>jdbc/samplejpadatasource</jta-data-source>` element which
specifies the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) name of the data source that is to be used by
the container. This means that a JDBC connection does not have to be specified in the `persistence.xml`
file and instead the JTA data source can be preconfigured.

Create the `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file:

[source, Xml]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[tags=**;]
----

A shared library is defined by the `<library id="derbyJDBCLib"></library>` element.
This element points to the directory of the JDBC driver. The JDBC driver is what enables the
application to interact with the database.

The data source configuration is done within the
`<dataSource id="samplejpadatasource jndiName="jdbc/samplejpadatasource"></dataSource>` element.
The `jndiName="jdbc/samplejpadatasource"` attribute provides a JNDI name for the data source so that
it can be looked up by other components in the application.

The data source configuration also contains properties such as the database name and whether
to create the database if it does not already exist. These properties can vary based on the
database that is being used.

=== Performing CRUD operations using JPA

CRUD is an abbreviation that defines the four basic functionalities that can be performed on a 
database: create, read, update and delete.

Create the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/dao/EventDao.java` file:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/dao/EventDao.java[tags=**;]
----

Every entity object has a lifecycle that consists of four states: new, managed, removed and 
detached. Whenever a new Event object is created its state will be new, meaning that it is not 
mapped to a row in the database table and is not associated with an EntityManger.

The EntityManager manages the lifecycle of entity instances. Every EntityManager instance is 
associated with a persistence context. The persistence context manages a set of entities and is 
aware of the different states that an entity can have.

Since the container is responsible for transaction boundaries, it is not necessary to explicitly
begin, commit or rollback transactions. The EJB container will ensure that the methods are executed 
within the boundaries of an active transaction. In order to use the EntityManager at runtime, it 
must be injected into our EJB component through the `@PersistenceContext` annotation.

The `EventDao.java` class has a method for each CRUD operation, so let's break them down:

* By calling the `persist` method in `createEvent`, an instance of the Event entity class will be 
persisted to the datastore. The event objects state is changed from new to managed, meaning the 
entity is now mapped to a row in the database table and is being managed by the `EntityManager`.

* By passing an entity class and primary key to the `find` method in `readEvent`, an Event object 
with the specified primary key will be retrieved. If the object being searched for is already 
managed by the `EventManager`, the event object will be returned as is and no retrieval from the 
database is required. But, if it is not already managed, a new entity object will be constructed 
with data retrieved from the database and returned in a managed state. If the event object is not 
found, `Null` is returned.

* The `updateEvent` method updates an Event object in the database. The `EntityManager` 
automatically tracks all managed entity objects in its persistence context for changes and 
synchronizes with the database. The `merge` method will create a managed instance of a detached 
entity object.

* The `deleteEvent` method deletes an Event object from the database by calling the `remove` method 
on an `EntityManager`. The managed entity will be removed from the database and the entity objects 
state becomes removed.

Note that when an entity is no longer associated with a persistence context, its changes will no 
longer be managed by the EntityManager and the entity becomes detached.

When the server is running, visit the {eventapp-url} URL to view the Event Manager application. 

Using the `Create event` button in the left navigation bar you are able to create events that will 
be persisted to the database. Once you have created an event, it will be available to view, update 
and delete in the `Event list` section.

== Testing the application

Create the `EventAppTest` test class in the `finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/tests/EventAppTest.java` 
file:

[source, Java]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/jpaguide/tests/EventAppTest.java[tags=**;]
----

The `testCreatingDeletingNewEvent` method creates a test event and then gets a list of events from
the {get-events-url} URL to verify that the test event is actually persisted to the database. Next, 
the test event is deleted from the database and the method gets a list of events from the 
{get-events-url} URL once more. This time, when attempting to retrieve the test event, the return 
value will be `Null` since the test event is removed from the database.

The `testUpdatingEvents` method also creates a test event and gets a list of events from the 
{get-events-url} URL to verify that the test event is actually persisted to the database. Next, the 
method updates the test event with a new name, location and time. A list of events is retrieved 
from the {get-events-url} once again to verify that the event is successfully updated in the 
database. Lastly, the updated test event is deleted from the database and the method gets a list of 
events from the {get-events-url} URL one final time. As expected, when attempting to retrieve the 
test event, the return value will be `Null` since the test event is removed from the database.

== Great work! You're done!

You have learned how to map Java objects to database tables by defining a JPA entity class whose 
instances are represented as rows in the table.

You have have used a container-managed `EntityManager` to manage entity instances and their 
lifecycles. You injected the `EntityManager` into an EJB component and performed basic CRUD 
operations on the database using JPA.
